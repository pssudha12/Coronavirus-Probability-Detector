# Coronavirus-Probability-Detector
Aim to detect the COVID cases quickly. Here, data is collected on the symptoms of COVID-19. Jupyter Notebook is used for the initial development and then created UI which tells whether the person has an infection or not based on input features using Virtual Studio Code IDE.
The machine learning model is trained on the data to find out the probability of a person having the infection which is to be used to find out whom to test for the infection first under a limited testing capacity.
